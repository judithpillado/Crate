// This file is like model enums in rails
// It defines model 'params' that aren't in the database but are usable for defining or sorting
// Makes a set list of options for the database to store particularly in an attribute

// This file is also repeated in web/src/setup/config
// Curly brace is a block
{
  // this creates usable params for product
